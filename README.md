# The-gallery-of-things
This website was made by me using JavaScript and CSS.
CSS aids in the size and orderly presentation of all the photos. When these photographs are hovered over, an expanded version of the image is presented separately. Using the inline JavaScript instruction "onmouseover" makes this easier.A default picture will be shown if no image is chosen.
Note: The graphics that are part of the source code are just used for demonstration purposes.
